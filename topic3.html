This is a richly enjoyable exploration of the life of a born performer with some great archive footage and rare photographs. A highly successful career on the London stage was put on hold when Bette discovered gay liberation. But out of a gay drag commune in Notting Hill, Bette fashioned a glorious theatre troupe Bloolips, bringing together a unique blend of costume, camp and musical theatre leavened with sexual politics. The film offers an insight into a passionate and gifted actor who has made a great contribution to gay life, art and politics.","release_date":"2013-03-21"},{"vote_count":1,"id":204757,"video":false,"vote_average":10,"title":"Matthew Bourne's Christmas","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"\/6cxZbixZGBnlNX6QX1ltEDDDmcx.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Matthew Bourne's Christmas","genre_ids":[10402],"backdrop_path":"\/jpb438HY686M8X7TagDOpK0okcf.jpg","adult":false,"overview":"Channel 4 has commissioned a new dance film with the choreographer Matthew Bourne, to be broadcast Christmas 2011. Conceived by Bourne and directed by the award-winning Ross MacGibbon, Bourne’s longstanding film collaborator, the new film brings together graphics, animation and 360 degree studio shooting, in a distinctive new way of presenting dance on screen.

Moving the Christmas party from a comfortable middle-class home to a Dickensian orphanage whose proprietors starve their wards to spoil their own children, it then shifts to a wonderland where sweets and sugar are a none-too-subtle metaphor for sexual awakening. In both worlds, Clara (Etta Murfitt) has to struggle to be heroine, or even a participant, in her own story and her struggle for the muscular, sexy Alan Vincent with her bitchy rival Sugar (Soranne Curtin) is not resolved until the last moments of the ballet. Along the way, Bourne finds charming and sexy ways to make all of the well-known genre moments of the score fresh and new--the Chinese dancers are a bunch of daffy marshmallow girls in pink, for example, whose dance is all strutting cuteness.","release_date":"2003-12-22"},{"vote_count":0,"id":533205,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Bournemouth Orchestra - Hungarian Rhapsody","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"\/iAQJfuEKzZwtyNKxGtHKTuCgiE3.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Bournemouth Orchestra - Hungarian Rhapsody","genre_ids":[10402,99],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Bournemouth Orchestra perform a piece of music - Liszt's \"Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2\".","release_date":"1937-01-01"},{"vote_count":0,"id":430796,"video":false,"vote_average":0,"title":"Sleeping Beauty: A Gothic Romance","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"\/sW37WJovqp0t3D2gCpwYhKNFRHf.jpg","original_language":"en","original_title":"Sleeping Beauty: A Gothic Romance","genre_ids":[10402],"backdrop_path":null,"adult":false,"overview":"Matthew Bourne choreographs this version of Tchaikovsky's ballet performed at Sadler's Wells Theatre.
